# Capstone-Project-Linux-Shell-Scripting
This project explores Bash scripting through loops, user input, and conditional logic. It highlights how loops automate repetitive tasks, user input makes scripts interactive, and conditions control execution flow. Together, these elements create dynamic and efficient scripts, forming a foundation for advanced automation.
